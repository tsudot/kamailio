# Set this to 'yes' to enable Kamailio to leave a core file when it crashes

# accepts 'yes' and 'no' and only in lowercase letters.
# On some systems (e.g. Ubuntu 6.10, Debian 4.0) it is necessary to specify
# a directory for the core files to get a dump. Look into the kamailio
# init file for an example configuration.
